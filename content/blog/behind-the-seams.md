Every Tzniut piece begins long before needle meets fabric. It starts with a feeling — a vision of how a woman should feel when she puts on one of our creations. Today, we're pulling back the curtain to show you exactly how that vision becomes reality.

## Phase 1: The Vision

Every collection begins with research and inspiration. We study art, architecture, nature, and most importantly, the women we design for. What does she need? How does she want to feel? What occasions matter most in her life?

From these questions, sketches emerge. Dozens of them, sometimes hundreds, before we find the designs that truly capture the essence of what we're trying to create.

## Phase 2: Fabric Selection

Fabric is everything. A dress can have the most beautiful design in the world, but if the fabric doesn't move right, feel right, and drape right, it's nothing more than an idea. 

We source our fabrics from trusted suppliers who share our commitment to quality — premium velvets, pure silks, French lace, and lightweight crepes that feel as good as they look.

## Phase 3: Pattern Making & Construction

This is where the magic happens. Our patterns are developed to ensure every piece fits beautifully while maintaining the modest coverage that defines Tzniut. Every dart, every seam, every hem is precisely calculated.

## Phase 4: The Final Touch

Before any piece leaves our studio, it undergoes a thorough quality check. We examine every stitch, press every seam, and ensure that the finished garment matches the vision we started with.
