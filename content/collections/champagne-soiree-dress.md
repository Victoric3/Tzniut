The Champagne Soirée Dress is for the evenings that matter most. Warm champagne tones cascade over a satin base, while intricate beadwork along the bodice adds a touch of sparkle without overwhelming the senses.

The column silhouette elongates the figure beautifully, and the full-length sleeves feature a sheer beaded tulle detail that adds dimension and interest. This is refined evening wear at its most magnificent — proof that conservative fashion can be the most captivating presence in any room.
