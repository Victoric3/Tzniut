The Ivory Eternal Gown is our love letter to the modest bride. This breathtaking ball gown features French lace detailing over a smooth satin base, with an organza overlay that creates an ethereal, dreamlike quality.

Every element has been considered: the high neckline frames the face beautifully, the long lace sleeves add timeless romance, and the cathedral-length train creates a dramatic entrance that will be remembered forever. This is the dress for the bride who wants it all — modesty, luxury, and a moment that takes everyone's breath away.
