The Power Tailored Set is for the woman who leads from the front. This two-piece set features a structured blazer with a mandarin collar and a flowing midi skirt that moves with purpose.

Crafted from a premium wool blend with a silk lining, every detail speaks to quality and intention. The modest neckline and below-the-knee length ensure comfort and confidence in any boardroom, while the impeccable tailoring guarantees you'll be the best-dressed person in the room. Available in Charcoal, Navy, and our signature Wine.
