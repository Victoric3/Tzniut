The Rosewood Wrap Dress is versatility personified. Crafted from flowing crepe with a comfortable jersey lining, this midi-length wrap is designed to flatter every figure while maintaining a gracefully modest silhouette.

The warm rosewood tone is both contemporary and timeless, making it equally perfect for a Saturday brunch, an office meeting, or an evening gathering. The adjustable wrap closure allows you to customize the fit, while the long bell sleeves add a touch of drama to this everyday essential.
